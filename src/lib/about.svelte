<h2>Thousands of cats are needlessly euthanized in Los Angeles each year,</h2>
<p>
  their only fault being that they don’t have a home. Los Angeles is home to one of the nation’s
  largest populations of homeless cats with an estimated one to three million living on the streets.

  <h3>“We need to do something!”</h3>
  <p>
    Eager to find a solution to the problem, Karn Myers and her husband Mark Dodge launched
    FixNation--the first full-time, permanent spay/neuter facility in Los Angeles. Now, their
    award-winning programs serve as a model for other communities and charities dealing with similar
    situations on a global scale.

  <h3>For the love of cats</h3>
  <p>
    At the heart of our high-volume, high-quality spay/neuter clinic is an experienced and expert
    team that genuinely cares about cats. In addition to free spay/neuter surgery, every homeless
    cat brought to FixNation receives vaccinations, fluids, antibiotics, pain medication and flea
    treatment.

  <h3>Our mission</h3>
  <p>
    Our mission is to humanely reduce the population of homeless cats in Los Angeles by sterilizing
    as many as possible and allowing their numbers to naturally decline over time.
